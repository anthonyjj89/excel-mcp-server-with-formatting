# Live Testing Validation & Smart Deletion Design

## Live Testing Results - PASSED âœ…
- Tested with Balich ARMUS Project file
- delete_rows: Works but limited (row-based deletion)
- clear_range: Excellent precision (cell-range based)

## Next Enhancement: Intelligent Range-Based Deletion
Current delete_rows approach has limitations:
- Blind row deletion without content awareness
- Cannot handle complex multi-range scenarios
- Risk of deleting unintended adjacent data

## Proposed Smart Deletion System:
1. Content analysis to identify target data
2. Multi-range detection (e.g., A1:D4 + A7:D12)
3. Range-by-range clearing using clear_range
4. Surgical precision with data preservation
